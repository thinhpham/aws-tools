Useful tools to manage Amazon AWS

## Notes
* Make you've configured the "config" and "credentials" files before using these scripts. Check for the existence of the ".aws" folder if you're not sure
* The ".aws" folder can be created either manually or by using "aws configure"
* The ".aws" folder is normally located in the following locations:
  * On Linux/Mac: ~/.aws
  * On Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\.aws (Normally C:\Users\username\.aws)
* "aws configure" requires the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli)
